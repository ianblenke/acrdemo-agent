# Agent Portal

This is a BETA version of the Agent Portal. Agent Portal is a website that maintains the Agent database. Additionally, the database is exposed via RESTful services by the aserver.

A future modification of the Agent Portal is to update the user screens to include new fields in the database (see the db folder).
